# Python Live Project Code Summary
## Introduction
Having completed a two week long sprint for The Tech Academy Python Live Project, this repository serves as a reference to my process. 

Using the Django Framework and PyCharm, the app I created is a Travel Guide to Japan. 

Featured below are code snippets that show the development of functionality of the code.

## CRUD Functionality
### Create
The first task was to create a model and function for adding a new place to the travel guide database.

### Read
I developed a views function that displays all items in the database on a details template.

### Update and Delete
From the details template, a user can update or delete an entry. The delete function will bring up a delete confirmation page, and then return the user to the details template.

## Web Scraping
### Beautiful Soup
To display a list of attractions from a website, I used Beautiful Soup and scrapped the headers for the names of the attractions.

#### Save

## API
I used the Kanji Alive [link to docs] API on RapidAPI to display a kanji character and it's english meaning.

## Skills Aquired
### <b>Version Control</b>
Git Version control was used extensively, as all team members worked off of local versions of the same remote repository. I created branches for each of the ten stories and successfully pushed them to the master without merge conflicts, giving me much experience in a professional work environment. I also much more appreciate version control capabilities having had more time and experience in using it during the sprint.

### <b>Researching/Troubleshooting</b>
When running into roadblocks, I searched online for answers. By using numerous different keywords and looking at different search results I became more adept at finding exactly what I was after. I also learned how useful looking at a variety of answers to a problem is, where I could cherry-pick different aspects I wanted to implement into my code.
