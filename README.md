# Python Live Project Code Summary
## Introduction
Having completed a two week long sprint for The Tech Academy Python Live Project, this repository serves as a reference to my process. 

Using the Django Framework and PyCharm, the app I created is a Travel Guide to Japan. Git Version Control[[checkname?]] was used extensively, as all team members worked off of local versions the same remote repository.

Featured below are code snippets that show the development of functionality of the code.

## CRUD Functionality
### Create
The first task was to create a model and function for adding a new place to the travel guide database.

### Read
I developed a views function that displays all items in the database on a details template.

### Update and Delete
From the details template, a user can update or delete an entry. The delete function will bring up a delete confirmation page, and then return the user to the details template.

## Web Scraping
### Beautiful Soup
To display a list of attractions from a website, I used Beautiful Soup and scrapped the headers for the names of the attractions.

## API
I used the Kanji Alive [link to docs] API on RapidAPI to display a kanji character and it's meaning.
